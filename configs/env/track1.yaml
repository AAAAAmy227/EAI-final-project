# Simulation frequency (must match real robot for sim2real)

sim_freq: 120       # Physics simulation frequency (Hz)
control_freq: 30    # Control frequency (Hz) - MUST match real data (30 Hz)

# Max episode steps based on trajectory analysis
# Formula: base_steps * multiplier
# lift: 296 steps, stack: 384 steps, sort: 619 steps (at 30 Hz)
episode_steps:
  base: 296         # Base from trajectory analysis (lift max)
  multiplier: 1.2   # 20% buffer for RL exploration
  # Effective max_episode_steps = 296 * 1.2 = 355 (for lift)
  # Override for stack: base=384, for sort: base=619
